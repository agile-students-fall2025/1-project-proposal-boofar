## What and Why?

MoodSphere, a mobile-friendly web application that helps users track their emotions, reflect on their mental well-being, and connect with friends for support.

Mental health challenges are increasingly common among students and young professionals, yet many people struggle to pause and check in with themselves. Journaling and mindfulness are proven strategies, but people often forget to practice them consistently. MoodSphere solves this by sending notifications throughout the day that encourage quick emotional check-ins, making self-reflection part of a daily routine.

By integrating journaling with social features, MoodSphere creates both a private space for self-care and an optional supportive community for users who want to share their feelings with trusted friends.

## For Whom?

MoodSphere is designed for college students and young adults who want an accessible, non-intimidating way to manage their emotions. Our initial end-users are our classmates, friends, and peers — people who already use mobile apps daily and who often express a need for better mental health support but may not be ready to pursue therapy. It also connects friends on another level by sharing moods and emotions in a unique, more entertaining manner. 

By targeting real, everyday users like ourselves, we can validate the app’s value quickly and adjust the design to make it engaging and useful.

## How?

From the end-user’s perspective, MoodSphere will include:

Mood Check-Ins: Users record their mood multiple times per day through quick prompts (e.g., “How are you feeling right now?”).

Smart Notifications: Gentle reminders throughout the day encourage consistency without being intrusive.

Guided Practices: Depending on the user’s mood, the app suggests activities (e.g., breathing exercises when anxious, gratitude prompts when feeling low, celebration notes when happy).

Mood Ball Visualization: A colorful ball represents the user’s emotions (red = anger, blue = sadness, yellow = happiness, purple = calm). Over time, the ball reflects a blend of feelings.

Friend Connection: Users can add friends to share moods and journal snippets. Friends can see each other’s Mood Ball and receive suggestions for how to support one another.

This combination of self-reflection and social connection helps normalize conversations about mental health while making journaling feel less isolating.

## Scope 

MoodSphere is appropriately scoped for a semester-long project by 4–6 programmers. Key features such as user authentication, journaling entries, notifications, and simple data visualizations are ambitious but achievable within the timeframe.

We will prioritize the core functionality (mood check-ins, journaling, and Mood Ball visualization), and treat social sharing and guided practices as extensions if time permits. This ensures we deliver a valuable product while leaving room for creative growth.
